# My_First_Assignment
Creation of a webpage/website
Your Task:

-You can then add demonstrative exercises to as links off your portfolio page as you go through
the course.

-A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it.

-Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web)
are typically very successful in their career search after web development training courses such
as this one.

-This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed examples (ideally, projects) is
a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

-With these points in mind, in this challenge you’ll set yourself up for future success by applying
the core skills you've recently learned and/or investigated: Flexbox, media queries, and CSS
variables.

Criteria CheckPoints

-When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links
to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you

-When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding
section

-When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your
applications

-When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be

-larger in size than the others
When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed
application

-When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is
responsive and adapts to my viewport
